Subject: Re: PTO Plan for the Next 4 Months

Hi [Manager's Name],

Thank you for checking in regarding the PTO planning.

As of now, I don’t have any planned time off scheduled for the next four months. If anything comes up, I’ll make sure to inform you well in advance and follow the proper process for applying.

Please let me know if you need anything else from my side.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

You can tweak the tone based on how formal your team is. Let me know if you'd like a more casual version or if you’re planning to take leave later but haven’t finalized it yet.
