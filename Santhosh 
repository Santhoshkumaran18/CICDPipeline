When testing a table with download functionality and filter conditions, there are multiple key scenarios and edge cases to ensure everything works as expected. Here's a structured set of test scenarios covering all functional, UI, and edge behaviors:


---

âœ… 1. Table Data Display (Pre-condition Check)

[ ] Table loads with default or full dataset

[ ] Columns are correctly displayed (headers and data match)

[ ] Pagination works (if applicable)



---

âœ… 2. Filter Functionality

Test filters individually and in combination:

ðŸ“Œ For each filter type (text, dropdown, date range, etc.):

[ ] Apply valid filter â€” relevant data is shown

[ ] Apply invalid/no-match filter â€” shows "No data found" or similar message

[ ] Apply multiple filters together â€” combination results correctly displayed

[ ] Clear filter resets table to original state

[ ] Case sensitivity and trimming (e.g., entering "Test" vs " test ")

[ ] Partial match support (e.g., typing "Pro" should show "Projector")



---

âœ… 3. Download Functionality

ðŸ“¥ Test the download button:

[ ] Download with no filters applied â€” all data is downloaded

[ ] Download after applying filters â€” only filtered data is downloaded

[ ] File is downloaded in correct format (e.g., CSV, Excel, PDF)

[ ] File name is correct and includes timestamp (if applicable)

[ ] File contains all visible columns (and hidden columns, if configured)

[ ] Download with 0 results (should download a blank file or show proper message)

[ ] Large dataset download (performance and file size)



---

âœ… 4. UI and UX Checks

[ ] Filter fields and buttons are aligned properly

[ ] Loading spinner shown when filtering/downloading

[ ] Download button disabled while downloading (to avoid double-click)

[ ] Toast or success message on download completion

[ ] Proper tooltips or labels on filters and download button



---

âœ… 5. Error and Boundary Scenarios

[ ] Server/API failure during filter fetch â€” proper error shown

[ ] Server/API failure during download â€” error handling works

[ ] Download button disabled when no data available

[ ] Input fields for filters accept valid formats only (e.g., date picker rejects text)



---

âœ… 6. Accessibility and Cross-browser Testing

[ ] Can filter using keyboard navigation

[ ] Download button is accessible (via keyboard or screen reader)

[ ] Consistent behavior across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari



---

âœ… 7. Security & Permissions

[ ] Download functionality not accessible to unauthorized users (if applicable)

[ ] Ensure no script injection possible via filter inputs
